⚠️  Atlas ui required 3 bins - consider reducing sprite count or increasing max size

(!) Some chunks are larger than 1000 kB after minification. Consider:
- Using dynamic import() to code-split the application
- Use build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks to improve chunking: https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-manualchunks
- Adjust chunk size limit for this warning via build.chunkSizeWarningLimit.
