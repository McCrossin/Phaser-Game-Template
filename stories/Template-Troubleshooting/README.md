**Epic ID**: TRBL-TROUBLESHOOT  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Type**: Production Support/Troubleshooting

## Purpose

This epic contains **PRODUCTION-READY TROUBLESHOOTING STORIES** designed for repeated use when debugging issues in any game project. These stories are **NEVER TO BE EDITED** and serve as standardized troubleshooting procedures.

## üö® CRITICAL USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

### For AI Agents and Developers:

1. **üîí NEVER EDIT THESE STORIES** - They are production procedures meant for repeated use across projects
2. **üìö REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION STORIES** - When troubleshooting a broken feature, reference the original implementation story alongside these troubleshooting stories
3. **‚úÖ FOLLOW EXACTLY** - These procedures have been tested and validated across multiple projects
4. **üéØ CONTEXT AWARENESS** - If a feature implementation broke something, you need BOTH:
    - The original feature implementation story (for context of what was changed)
    - The appropriate troubleshooting story from this epic (for systematic debugging)
5. **‚ö†Ô∏è MAKE FIXES IN IMPLEMENTATION STORIES ONLY** - Any code changes or fixes should be made based on findings from troubleshooting, but the troubleshooting stories themselves must remain unchanged

## Story Categories
