- `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`: Security scanning workflow
- `.github/workflows/health-monitoring.yml`: Health monitoring workflow
- `package.json`: Scripts and dependencies for CI
- CI-specific configuration files

### Key Classes and Interfaces

```typescript
interface CIWorkflowResult {
    success: boolean;
    duration: number;
    failedJobs: string[];
    errors: WorkflowError[];
    artifacts: Artifact[];
}

interface WorkflowConfiguration {
    triggers: string[];
    jobs: Job[];
    environment: Record<string, string>;

# Check YAML syntax and GitHub Actions schema
# Use GitHub's workflow editor for validation
# Verify job dependencies and matrix configurations
# Ensure proper indentation and structure
```

**Fix Common Configuration Issues**:

```yaml
name: Game CI Pipeline

on:
    pull_request:
        branches: [main, develop]
    push:
        branches: [main, develop]

jobs:
    test:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        timeout-minutes: 10

        steps:
            - name: Checkout code
              uses: actions/checkout@v4

            - name: Setup Node.js
              uses: actions/setup-node@v4
              with:
                  node-version: '22.17.1'
                  cache: 'npm'
```

**Check Permissions and Secrets**:

```yaml
permissions:
    contents: read
    packages: write
    security-events: write

env:
    NODE_ENV: ci
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### 4. Resolve Dependency Installation Issues

**Estimated Time**: 1 hour

Fix dependency installation problems in CI environment.

**Technical Details**:

**Update package.json for CI**:

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "ci:install": "npm ci --prefer-offline --no-audit",
        "ci:build": "npm run build",
        "ci:test": "npm run test:ci"
    }
}
```

**Fix Caching Issues**:

```yaml
- name: Cache node modules
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
      path: ~/.npm
      key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
      restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.os }}-node-
```

**Handle Network and Timeout Issues**:

```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: |
      npm ci --prefer-offline --no-audit --timeout=300000
  timeout-minutes: 5
```

### 5. Fix Test Execution Problems

**Estimated Time**: 1.5 hours

Resolve test failures specific to CI environment.

**Technical Details**:

**Environment-Specific Test Configuration**:

```json
// package.json
{
    "scripts": {
        "test:ci": "vitest run --reporter=verbose --coverage",
        "test:e2e:ci": "playwright test --reporter=github"
    }
}
```

**Update Test Configuration for CI**:

```typescript
// vitest.config.ci.ts
export default defineConfig({
    test: {
        environment: 'node',
        timeout: 30000,
        threads: false, // Disable threading in CI
        coverage: {
            reporter: ['text', 'json', 'html']
        }
    }
});
```

**Fix E2E Test CI Issues**:

```yaml
- name: Install Playwright browsers
  run: npx playwright install --with-deps

  run: npm run test:e2e:ci
  env:
      CI: true
```

### 6. Resolve Build and Deployment Issues

**Estimated Time**: 1 hour

Fix build process and deployment problems in CI.

**Technical Details**:

**CI-Specific Build Configuration**:

```typescript
// vite.config.ci.ts
export default defineConfig({

        sourcemap: false, // Disable source maps in CI for speed
        minify: true,
        target: 'es2022'
    },
    test: {
        environment: 'node'
    }
});
```

**Update CI Scripts**:

## üîí CRITICAL REMINDER

**NEVER EDIT THIS TROUBLESHOOTING STORY**

This is a production troubleshooting procedure designed for repeated use. If troubleshooting a feature implementation that broke the CI pipeline:

1. ‚úÖ **Use this story** for systematic debugging steps
2. ‚úÖ **Reference the original feature story** for context of what was changed
3. ‚úÖ **Make all fixes in the original feature story** based on findings here
4. ‚ùå **Never modify this troubleshooting story** - keep it clean for future use

Remember: The goal is to identify CI issues using this systematic approach, then apply fixes in the appropriate implementation stories.
