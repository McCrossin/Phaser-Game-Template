# Story: Remove Template Artifacts and Fix GitHub Processes

**ID**: CLEANUP-002  
**Epic**: Template-Cleanup  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Points**: 3  
**Dependencies**: CLEANUP-001

## Description

Remove template-specific artifacts and fix GitHub processes that are currently running template cleanup scripts during commits and pushes. This story focuses on cleaning up template-specific npm scripts, Husky git hooks, GitHub workflows, and development tools that are designed for template maintenance rather than game development.

### Player Experience Goal

Developers will have a clean git workflow without template-specific validation scripts running on every commit and push. The development experience will be faster and more focused on game development rather than template maintenance.

## AI Agent Handoff Strategy

This story is designed for **multi-agent collaboration** with 6 clearly defined handoff points. Each agent should complete their assigned task(s) and document results before the next agent continues.

### ðŸ”„ Agent Handoff Points Summary:

1. **Task 1 Completion**: Template artifact audit and removal strategy
2. **Task 2 Completion**: Package.json cleanup and script validation
3. **Task 3 Completion**: Husky hooks update and testing
4. **Task 4 Completion**: GitHub workflow cleanup and validation
5. **Task 5 Completion**: Tool and script removal with documentation
6. **Final Validation**: Complete workflow testing and handoff preparation

**CRITICAL**: Each agent must verify zero linting errors and functional git workflows before handoff to the next agent.
