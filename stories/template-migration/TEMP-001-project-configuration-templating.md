# Story: Remove New Eden Project Specific Configuration

**ID**: TEMP-001  
**Epic**: Template Conversion  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Points**: 3  
**Dependencies**: None

## Description

Remove all New Eden Project-specific configuration, branding, and references from project configuration files to create a reusable 2D Phaser game template. This includes package.json, README.md, and other root-level configuration files.

### Player Experience Goal

Developers using this template will have a clean slate with no game-specific content, allowing them to start their own 2D Phaser game without having to manually remove New Eden content.

### Technical Overview

Replace all New Eden references with template placeholders or generic game development terminology. Update package.json, README.md, and configuration files to be generic but maintain the CI/CD pipeline and health checking functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [x] Package.json contains generic name, description, and keywords
- [x] README.md provides template usage instructions instead of New Eden documentation
- [x] All configuration files reference generic project structure
- [x] CI/CD pipeline remains functional but generic
- [x] Health check and benchmarking tools remain intact
- [x] Template usage documentation is complete

### Technical Requirements

- [x] Package.json name changed from "new-eden-project" to "phaser-game-template"
- [x] Description updated to reflect template nature
- [x] Author field updated to be generic
- [x] Keywords updated for general 2D game development
- [x] All scripts remain functional
- [x] Environment configurations remain intact

### Game Design Requirements

- [x] No game-specific references in configuration
- [x] Template maintains Phaser 3 + TypeScript setup
- [x] Performance monitoring tools preserved
- [x] Development workflow intact

## Technical Specifications

### Files to Modify

1. **package.json**
    - Update name, description, author, keywords
    - Preserve all scripts and dependencies
2. **README.md**
    - Replace New Eden content with template documentation
    - Provide setup instructions for new projects
    - Document included features (CI/CD, health checks, etc.)

3. **Root Configuration Files**
    - Update any project-specific references
    - Ensure configurations remain functional

### Package.json Changes

```json
{
    "name": "phaser-game-template",
    "description": "Professional 2D Phaser game template with CI/CD, health checks, and TypeScript",
    "author": "Template Author",
    "keywords": ["phaser3", "typescript", "game-template", "2d-game", "vite", "ci-cd"]
}
```

### README.md Structure

- Template overview and features
- Quick start guide
- Included tools and systems
- Development workflow
- Deployment instructions

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Package Configuration (0.5 days)

1. Update package.json with generic template information
2. Verify all scripts continue to function
3. Test build and development processes

### Phase 2: Documentation Update (1 day)

1. Create new template-focused README.md
2. Document template features and capabilities
3. Add quick start instructions
4. Include template customization guide

### Phase 3: Configuration Files (0.5 days)

1. Update any remaining project-specific references
2. Ensure all configurations are generic
3. Test complete development workflow

### Phase 4: Validation (1 day)

1. Test template setup from scratch
2. Verify all tools and pipelines function
3. Validate documentation accuracy
4. Performance test the template

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

- All existing build processes pass
- Configuration loading works correctly
- Scripts execute without errors

### Integration Tests

- Complete development workflow functions
- CI/CD pipeline executes successfully
- Health checks and monitoring tools work

### Performance Tests

- Template maintains performance benchmarks
- Development build times acceptable

## Definition of Done

### Implementation Complete

- [x] Package.json fully templated
- [x] README.md provides complete template documentation
- [x] All configuration files are generic
- [x] No New Eden specific references remain

### Quality Assurance

- [x] All scripts and tools function correctly
- [x] Development workflow operates smoothly
- [x] Documentation is clear and complete
- [x] Template can be used to start new projects

### Technical Validation

- [x] Build processes work correctly
- [x] Health monitoring tools function
- [x] Performance benchmarks maintained
- [x] CI/CD pipeline operates without issues

### Handoff Requirements

- [x] Template documentation complete
- [x] Usage instructions validated
- [x] All tools tested and functional
- [x] Ready for distribution

This story establishes the foundation for converting the New Eden Project into a reusable template while preserving all the valuable CI/CD and monitoring infrastructure.
