### Configuration Updates Required

#### Health Check Configuration

```typescript
// tools/monitoring/health-check.ts - Generic project checks
interface HealthCheckConfig {
    projectName: string; // Configurable project name
    performanceTargets: {
        buildTime: number; // Max build time (seconds)
        bundleSize: number; // Max bundle size (MB)
        frameRate: number; // Target FPS
    };
    qualityThresholds: {
        testCoverage: number; // Minimum test coverage %
        codeComplexity: number; // Max cyclomatic complexity
        techDebtScore: number; // Max technical debt score
    };
}
```

#### CI/CD Pipeline Updates

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml - Template-ready pipeline
name: Template CI/CD
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
    test:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v4
            - name: Setup Node.js
              uses: actions/setup-node@v4
              with:
                  node-version: '18'
            # ... rest of pipeline
```
