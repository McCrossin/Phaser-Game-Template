# Story: CI/CD Template Reliability and GitHub Actions Performance Monitoring

**ID**: TEMP-016  
**Epic**: Template Migration  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Points**: 4  
**Dependencies**: TEMP-015

## Description

Resolve the ongoing issue where GitHub Actions performance monitoring works locally but fails in the GitHub environment. Create a reliable, consistent CI/CD pipeline that template users can depend on for their own projects, with robust performance monitoring that works both locally and in GitHub Actions.

### Player Experience Goal

Developers using this template will have a reliable CI/CD pipeline with consistent performance monitoring that works seamlessly in both local development and GitHub Actions environments, providing confidence in their deployment process.

### Technical Overview

Investigate and fix the discrepancies between local and GitHub Actions environments, implement robust error handling and logging for performance monitoring, and create a reliable CI/CD pipeline configuration that template users can trust.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Performance monitoring works consistently in GitHub Actions
- [ ] Local development and CI environments produce same results
- [ ] Clear error messages when monitoring fails
- [ ] Automated retry mechanisms for transient failures
- [ ] Comprehensive logging for debugging issues

### Technical Requirements

- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow passes consistently (>95% success rate)
- [ ] Performance metrics collection works in both environments
- [ ] Environment-specific configurations properly handled
- [ ] Timeout and retry logic implemented
- [ ] Resource allocation optimized for CI environment

### Game Design Requirements

- [ ] Performance monitoring covers game-specific metrics (FPS, load times)
- [ ] CI pipeline validates game performance standards
- [ ] Template users can easily configure performance thresholds

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

The CI/CD pipeline is a critical component of the template that ensures code quality and performance standards. It must work reliably across different environments and provide meaningful feedback to developers.

### Files to Create/Modify

- `.github/workflows/performance-monitoring.yml`: Updated workflow with reliability fixes
- `scripts/performance-check.js`: Enhanced performance monitoring script
- `scripts/ci-environment-setup.sh`: Environment preparation script
- `config/ci-performance-thresholds.json`: Environment-specific thresholds
- `docs/ci-cd-troubleshooting.md`: Troubleshooting guide

### Key Classes and Interfaces

```typescript
interface PerformanceConfig {
    environment: 'local' | 'ci';
    thresholds: {
        buildTime: number;
        bundleSize: number;
        fps: number;
        loadTime: number;
    };
    retry: {
        maxAttempts: number;
        backoffDelay: number;
    };
}

interface MonitoringResult {
    success: boolean;
    metrics: Record<string, number>;
    errors: string[];
    environment: string;
    timestamp: string;
}
```

### Integration Points

- **GitHub Actions**: Workflow execution environment
- **Performance Monitoring**: Metrics collection and validation
- **Build System**: Integration with build process
- **Reporting**: Results output and artifact storage

### Performance Requirements

- CI workflow completes within 10 minutes
- Performance monitoring adds <2 minutes to build time
- 95% success rate for CI pipeline
- Reliable metric collection across environments

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Analyze Current CI/CD Failures

Investigate why performance monitoring fails in GitHub Actions.

**Estimated Time**: 2 hours
**Technical Details**:

- Review GitHub Actions logs for failure patterns
- Compare local vs CI environment configurations
- Identify resource constraints or timing issues
- Document root causes of failures

### 2. Implement Environment Detection and Configuration

Create environment-aware configuration system.

**Estimated Time**: 1.5 hours
**Technical Details**:

- Detect if running in GitHub Actions vs local
- Load environment-specific configurations
- Adjust timeouts and resource limits for CI
- Handle environment-specific dependencies

### 3. Add Robust Error Handling and Retry Logic

Implement comprehensive error handling for transient failures.

**Estimated Time**: 2 hours
**Technical Details**:

- Add retry logic for network-dependent operations
- Implement exponential backoff for retries
- Capture and log detailed error information
- Graceful degradation when monitoring fails

### 4. Optimize CI Resource Usage

Ensure efficient use of GitHub Actions resources.

**Estimated Time**: 1.5 hours
**Technical Details**:

- Optimize memory and CPU usage
- Cache dependencies effectively
- Parallel processing where possible
- Minimize external API calls

### 5. Create Comprehensive Logging and Debugging

Implement detailed logging for troubleshooting.

**Estimated Time**: 1 hour
**Technical Details**:

- Log environment details and configurations
- Capture performance metrics with timestamps
- Store logs as GitHub Actions artifacts
- Create debugging documentation

### 6. Test and Validate Reliability

Ensure consistent performance across multiple runs.

**Estimated Time**: 2 hours
**Technical Details**:

- Run multiple CI builds to test consistency
- Validate performance metrics accuracy
- Test failure scenarios and recovery
- Update documentation with findings

## Game Design Context

### GDD References

- Performance Standards: CI must validate game performance requirements
- Quality Assurance: Automated testing ensures game quality

### Balance Parameters

```typescript
const CI_CONFIG = {
    performance: {
        buildTimeLimit: 600, // 10 minutes
        bundleSizeLimit: 10485760, // 10MB
        fpsMinimum: 55, // 55 FPS minimum
        loadTimeLimit: 3000 // 3 seconds
    },
    reliability: {
        maxRetries: 3,
        successThreshold: 0.95,
        timeoutMultiplier: 1.5 // CI timeout = local * 1.5
    }
};
```

### Visual/Audio Requirements

- **CI Dashboard**: Clear visualization of build and performance status
- **Documentation**: Screenshots of successful CI runs

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

- `test/ci-config.test.ts`: Validates CI configuration loading
- `test/performance-monitoring.test.ts`: Tests monitoring functionality

### Integration Tests
