## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

The GitHub Actions pipeline is a critical part of the template infrastructure, providing automated quality assurance and deployment capabilities for any project created from this template.

### Files to Create/Modify

- `scripts/test-github-actions-local.ps1`: Script to test workflows locally
- `scripts/verify-ci-setup.ps1`: Script to verify CI configuration
- `.github/workflows/*.yml`: Review and test all workflow files
- `docs/ci-cd-setup.md`: Documentation for CI/CD configuration
- `package.json`: Add scripts for local CI testing

### Key Classes and Interfaces

```typescript
// CI/CD testing utilities
interface WorkflowTestResult {
    workflowName: string;
    status: 'success' | 'failure' | 'skipped';
    duration: number;
    errors?: string[];
    artifacts?: string[];
}

interface CIVerificationConfig {
    workflows: string[];
    requiredSecrets: string[];
    requiredVariables: string[];
    testMatrix: Record<string, any>;
}
```

### Integration Points

- **GitHub API**: For workflow status verification
- **Build System**: Vite build process in CI
- **Testing Framework**: All test suites in CI environment

**Technical Details**:

- Review `.github/workflows/*.yml` files for syntax errors
- Verify all required actions versions are current
- Test each workflow locally with act
- Check workflow triggers and conditions
- Validate caching and artifact strategies

### 3. Test Build Pipeline

Verify the build process works correctly in CI environment.

**Estimated Time**: 2 hours
**Technical Details**:

- Validate build caching mechanisms

### 4. Test Testing Pipeline

Ensure all test suites run correctly in CI.

**Estimated Time**: 2 hours
**Technical Details**:

- Run unit tests (Vitest) in CI environment
- Execute end-to-end tests (Playwright) in CI
- Test coverage report generation and upload
- Verify test result reporting and annotations
- Check test parallelization and timeouts

### 5. Test Deployment Workflows

Verify deployment processes work correctly.

**Estimated Time**: 2 hours
**Technical Details**:

- Test staging deployment workflow
- Verify production deployment (if safe)
- Check environment variable handling
- Test rollback procedures
- Validate deployment status reporting

### 6. Verify Security and Secrets Management

Ensure secure handling of secrets and sensitive data.

**Estimated Time**: 1 hour
**Technical Details**:

- Review secrets usage in workflows
- Verify no secrets are exposed in logs
- Check environment variable security
- Test secret rotation procedures
- Document required secrets for template users

### 7. Document CI/CD Setup and Usage

Create comprehensive documentation for the CI/CD system.

**Estimated Time**: 2 hours
**Technical Details**:

- Document all workflows and their purposes
- Create setup guide for new projects
- List all required secrets and variables
- Provide troubleshooting guide
- Include local testing instructions

## Game Design Context

### GDD References

- N/A - Infrastructure story

### Balance Parameters
