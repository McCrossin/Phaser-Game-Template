============================================

# 1. Introduction
## 1.1 Context

This file outlines a general overview of the high-level requirements for the game project I wish to make. My goal is to create a unique game experience by combining and refining elements from games I have greatly enjoyed. I am particularly drawn to games that reward players for investing time and mastering complex systems.

- **Automation** (favourite genre)
    - Factorio
    - Dyson Sphere Program
    - Satisfactory

- **Idle Games**

## 1.3 Game Design Goals
- **Complex Systems**: The game should feature intricate systems that players can learn and master over time.
- **Rewarding Mastery**: Players should feel rewarded for investing time and effort into understanding the game's mechanics.
- **Automation Elements**: Incorporate automation mechanics similar to those in Factorio, Dyson Sphere Program, and Satisfactory, allowing players to optimize and streamline their gameplay.
- **Simple mechanics and clear goals**: The game should have straightforward mechanics and clear objectives, making it accessible to a wide audience while still offering depth for those who seek it. Players should be able to focus on one thing at a time in a "what is next" gameplay loop rather than being overwhelmed by complexity.
- **Capture a flow state**: Design gameplay loops that encourage players to enter a flow state, where they are fully immersed and engaged in the game.

# 2. Specification
## 2.1 Concept
The game will be a 2D automation-focused experience, where players can build and optimize complex systems to achieve their goals. The gameplay will encourage exploration, experimentation, and mastery of the game's mechanics. The game is intended to be a PVE experience, with the potential of adding co-op multiplayer in the future. The game will not feature any PVP elements, as the focus is on cooperative gameplay and shared exploration.

Initial name idea - Galactic Automation Command
A 2D automation/strategy hybrid where you control a von Neumann probe. The probe can land, build, and automate resource extraction and manufacturing. The initial goal is to extract resources and to be able to replicate yourself, allowing you to expand your influence across the galaxy. A core story beat in the game is when the first replication happens, conciousness is not replicated properly, and the player has to transfer their conciousness between probes to allow for complex instructions. This is represented by the player's perpective in the game. Each replicated probe will be able to be programmed with different tasks and priorities, allowing for complex automation setups. These tasks can include resource extraction, manufacturing, and exploration. The game will feature a variety of planets and star systems, each with unique resources and challenges to overcome. Players will need to adapt their strategies based on the environment and available resources. The players goal is to outpace rival countries (AI-controlled) in claiming and automating star systems. Diplomacy and sabotage are handled through automated subroutines rather than direct combat, keeping the focus on PVE and optimization.

The AI-controller competitiveness will take inspiration from idle games, for example, the intention is for combat to happen in an "idle" format and the input from the player to be upgrades, more units and resources, rather than direct combat.


## 2.2 Setting
The world and story will have a heavy focus on the concept of a von Neumann probe, the players themselves starting as a probe and expanding their influence and capabilities. In the setting of the game, the player will be a probe that originates from a country on earth, and there is a space war going on between the countries to be the first to conquer the stars. The players main goal is to claim various planets and stars for the country they are from, and while doing so competing with other countries. Ideally the player should be able to choose their starting country, which will determine certain aspects of the game, such as starting resources, technology, and initial objectives. The lore will be built around the automation mechanics, with the story serving as a backdrop to the gameplay rather than the main focus.

## 2.3 Engine and Graphics
- **Engine Choice**: The latest unreal engine is the preferred choice as it's payment model means I only need to pay a portion of the profits once I start making money from the game. I have since made a decision to use phaser after further research.
- **2D Graphics**: The game will feature 2D graphics, with a focus on simplicity and clarity. The graphics should be visually appealing but not overly complex, allowing players to easily understand the game mechanics and objectives.

## 2.4 Game Mechanics
- **Character Progression**: Implement a character progression system that allows players to develop their characters in meaningful ways.
- **Skill Trees**: Include skill trees or similar systems that allow for diverse character builds and playstyles.
- **Crafting and Resource Management**: Introduce crafting mechanics that require players to gather resources and create items, similar to those in Path of Exile and/or Factorio.

## 2.5 User Interface
- **Intuitive Controls**: Design the user interface to be intuitive and easy to navigate, allowing players to quickly access information and controls.
- **Feedback Systems**: Implement feedback systems that provide players with clear information about their actions and the game state.
- **Customization Options**: Allow players to customize the user interface to suit their preferences and playstyles.

# 3. Gameplay

## 3.1 World and Lore
- **Wife input**: I would like to allow my wife to contribute to the world and lore of the game, as she has a strong interest in these aspects. At this stage I plan to have the world and lore built around the automation mechanics, with the lore being a backdrop to the gameplay rather than the main focus.
