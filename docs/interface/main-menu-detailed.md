- **Purpose**: Establish exploration-focused gameplay without time pressure

### Phase 2: Stellar Cartography (60-90 seconds)
**2D Stellar Map with 3D Depth Illusion**:
- **Layered Depth Technique**:
  - Multiple parallax star field layers at different speeds
  - Dotted elliptical orbital rings showing planet paths at slight angles
  - Star brightness and size indicating 3D distance
  - Curved probe trajectory lines showing 3D travel through 2D space

**Interactive Elements**:
- **System Selection**: Click systems to zoom from galaxy ‚Üí system ‚Üí planet views
- **Distance Indicators**: "2.3 light-years", "0.8 AU from star" for spatial context
- **Orbital Motion**: Planets slowly moving along elliptical paths for 3D feel

### Phase 3: Interactive Planet Selection (45-60 seconds)
**Recommended Planet Option**:
- **"Darwin's Garden"**: Prominently featured as the recommended starting world
- **Visual Highlight**: Green border with "MISSION RECOMMENDED" label
- **Design Philosophy**: Perfectly balanced for learning, optimal resource distribution
- **Alternative Options**: Other planets marked as "CHALLENGING" or "EXPERT LEVEL"

**Planet Preview System**:
- **Geological Cross-Section**: Visual layers showing surface ‚Üí core composition
- **Resource Distribution**: Periodic table elements scattered in appropriate geological layers
- **Environmental Animations**: Storm systems, volcanic activity, atmospheric density visualization

### Phase 4: Core Gameplay Mode Selection (30-45 seconds)
**Two Primary Gameplay Paths**:

**Renewable Sustainability Mode**:
- **Visual Theme**: Green highlighting on renewable energy sources
- **Objective**: *"Achieve completely sustainable systems by terraforming completion"*
- **Gameplay Impact**: Emphasis on recycling, efficiency, closed-loop systems
- **Win Condition**: Zero waste, 100% renewable energy megacity

**Exploration & Extraction Mode**:
- **Visual Theme**: Blue highlighting on asteroid belts, neighboring worlds
- **Objective**: *"Maximize resource acquisition through aggressive space expansion"*
- **Gameplay Impact**: Multi-planet operations, asteroid mining, rapid scaling
- **Win Condition**: Resource abundance enabling advanced technologies

### Phase 5: Mission Parameters (45-60 seconds)
**Planet Analysis Report Template**:
