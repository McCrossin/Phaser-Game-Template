- **Mitigation**: Extensive playtesting, alternative unlock paths, difficulty options
- **Contingency**: Simplify replication requirements or add intermediate progress saves

**Multi-Probe Fleet Management**
- **Risk**: UI complexity may overwhelm players, performance issues with large fleets
- **Mitigation**: Progressive complexity introduction, performance optimization focus
- **Contingency**: Limit fleet size to 3 probes for MVP, expand post-launch

**Energy System Balance**
- **Risk**: Energy constraints too punishing or too lenient
- **Mitigation**: Extensive balance testing, multiple difficulty levels
- **Contingency**: Real-time balance adjustment via configuration files

#### Risk Level: MEDIUM
**Equipment Bay Drag-and-Drop**
- **Risk**: Touch interface challenges, complex state management
- **Mitigation**: Early prototyping, responsive design testing
- **Contingency**: Fallback to button-based equipment selection

**Save/Load System Complexity**
- **Risk**: Large game state may cause performance issues or corruption
- **Mitigation**: Incremental saves, compression, validation systems
- **Contingency**: Simplified save format with reduced state tracking

**Circuit Manufacturing Timing**
- **Risk**: Manufacturing process may feel too slow or too fast
- **Mitigation**: Player feedback integration, configurable timing
- **Contingency**: Alternative progression paths that don't require circuits

#### Risk Level: LOW
**Environmental Protection Equipment**
- **Risk**: Complexity may confuse new players
- **Mitigation**: Clear visual feedback, tutorial integration
- **Contingency**: Make environmental protection optional for MVP

**Tutorial Flow Optimization**
- **Risk**: Tutorial too long or too short for different player types
- **Mitigation**: A/B testing, skip options, multiple paths
