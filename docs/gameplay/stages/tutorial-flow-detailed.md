# Tutorial Flow - Detailed Implementation

## Core Learning Philosophy

### Problem-First Discovery
Never explain systems before players encounter the need. Let natural consequences teach trade-offs and limitations.

### Emotional Progression Arc
1. **Frustration** (1-slot equipment juggling)
2. **Relief** (3D printer unlocks equipment bay expansion)  
3. **Challenge** (advanced materials require specialization)
4. **Victory** (multi-probe specialization freedom)

## Phase-by-Phase Implementation

### Phase 1: Consciousness Awakening (2-3 minutes)

#### Opening Narrative Experience
```
PROBE UNIT 7 - CONSCIOUSNESS INITIALIZATION
Location: 3.2m below surface, Planet Darwin's Garden
Power: 87% (DECREASING)
Mission Status: SURVIVE

Systems coming online...
Basic Scanner: OPERATIONAL
Mining Laser: STORED (Equipment Bay: 1/1 FULL)
Solar Panel Construction: REQUIRED

WARNING: Power consumption exceeds generation
Estimated survival time: 47 minutes
```

#### Natural Interaction Discovery
- **WASD Movement**: No tutorial text, players discover organically
- **Scanner Operation**: Hold SPACE automatically explained via UI hint when looking at resources
- **Equipment Limitation**: Can't equip both scanner and mining laser - immediate constraint experience

#### Energy Pressure System
- **Power Drain**: 2% per minute without solar panels
- **Solar Panel Requirements**: Iron + Silicon + Carbon
- **Urgency Creation**: Real survival pressure drives exploration and resource gathering

### Phase 2: Single-Slot Equipment Juggling (4-5 minutes)

#### The Core Learning Challenge
**Resource Detection vs. Extraction Conflict**:
1. **Scanner Equipped**: Find iron deposit, see "Iron ore detected - 78% purity"
2. **Mining Attempt**: "ERROR: No extraction tool equipped"
3. **Equipment Swap**: Scanner → Mining Laser via equipment interface
4. **Extraction Success**: Mine iron ore successfully
5. **New Problem**: Need silicon for solar panel, but can't scan for it
6. **Repeat Cycle**: Mining Laser → Scanner, find silicon, swap back to extract

#### Solar Panel Construction Process
**Required Materials**: 15 Iron + 8 Silicon + 5 Carbon
**Construction Interface**: Simple assembly interface showing material slots
**Immediate Relief**: Solar panels provide +3% power generation per minute
**Energy Stabilization**: First moment of non-survival gameplay

#### Circuit Production Introduction
**Gold Discovery**: Scanner reveals "Metallic signature - high conductivity"
**Advanced Analysis**: Gold deposits require Chemical Extractor (not yet available)
**Circuit Technology Preview**: "Gold required for cutting-edge 7nm circuit fabrication"
**Engineering Context**: "Current-generation flagship CPU technology within reach"

### Phase 3: 3D Printer Construction & Equipment Bay Relief (3-4 minutes)

#### 3D Printer Material Requirements
**Advanced Materials Needed**:
- **Structural Frame**: 25 Iron + 10 Titanium (titanium requires advanced drill)
- **Processing Unit**: 12 Silicon + 8 Gold (gold requires chemical extraction)
- **Power Systems**: 15 Carbon + 6 Lithium (lithium found in mountain deposits)
- **Circuit Integration**: Silicon wafer + Gold wiring + Transistor assembly

#### The Great Equipment Shuffle
**Challenge Intensification**: Need 3+ different extraction tools for 3D printer components
- **Basic Mining**: Iron extraction with standard laser
- **Advanced Drilling**: Titanium requires specialized equipment  
- **Chemical Processing**: Gold and lithium need different extraction methods
- **Constant Swapping**: Single slot forces continuous equipment cycling

#### Major Milestone Achievement
**3D Printer Completion**:
```
3D PRINTER CONSTRUCTION COMPLETE
Advanced fabrication capabilities now available.
Transistor manufacturing: CURRENT-GEN (7nm)
Circuit complexity: MODERN FLAGSHIP CPU TECHNOLOGY

First print job recommended: EQUIPMENT BAY EXPANSION
Cost: 8 Iron + 4 Silicon + 2 Gold circuits
Benefit: +1 Equipment Slot (Total: 2 slots)
```

#### Immediate Relief Experience
**Equipment Bay Expansion**: First thing printed from 3D printer
**Slot Liberation**: Scanner + Mining Laser equipped simultaneously
**Capability Transformation**: Can now scan and extract without constant swapping
**Player Satisfaction**: "Finally! I can do both at once!"

### Phase 4: Environmental Challenge Introduction (4-5 minutes)

#### Advanced Material Challenges
**Replication Requirements Preview**: Show probe blueprint requiring advanced materials
- **Titanium Frame**: "Requires Advanced Mining Drill"
- **Lithium Battery**: "Requires Chemical Extractor"
- **High-Purity Silicon**: "Requires Purification Module"
- **Gold Circuits**: "Requires Cleanroom Fabrication"

#### Environmental Barrier Discovery
**Underwater Carbon Deposits**: Rich carbon sources below water line
**Access Problem**: Standard equipment takes damage in water environment
**Solution Introduction**: Pressure Hull module protects against water pressure
**Slot Cost**: Pressure Hull requires 2 equipment slots (heavy protection)

#### Strategic Decision Point
**Equipment Configuration Choices**:
1. **Scanner + Pressure Hull**: Safe exploration, but can't extract
2. **Mining Laser + Pressure Hull**: Can extract if you find deposits blindly
3. **Surface Strategy**: Find alternative carbon sources on land (lower quality)
4. **Equipment Swapping**: Scan at surface, swap gear, extract underwater

### Phase 5: First Replication Achievement (1-2 minutes)

#### Component Assembly Satisfaction
**3D Printer Working**: Watch complex probe components being fabricated
**Material Integration**: See resources transform into sophisticated probe parts
**Technical Marvel**: Advanced circuits with cutting-edge 7nm transistors
**Engineering Achievement**: "Modern flagship CPU technology successfully replicated"
**Progress Visualization**: Assembly progress bar and component completion

#### Consciousness Transfer Magic Moment

#### Immediate Strategic Transformation
**Automatic Specialization Suggestion**:
- **Probe A**: "Configure as Resource Scout? (Scanner + Advanced Drill + Purification + Solar)"
- **Probe B**: "Configure as Mobile Processor? (Chemical Extractor + Fabricator + Storage + Comms)"

**Player Realization**: "I can have dedicated specialist probes instead of constantly swapping equipment!"
