### Hybrid Consciousness Transfer & Multi-Probe Control System

**Design Philosophy**: Balance performance requirements with consciousness transfer narrative experience

#### Consciousness Transfer Evolution
**Phase 1: Single Probe Mastery**
1. **Direct Control**: Full WASD control, real-time decision making
2. **Performance Target**: 60 FPS with complete player agency
3. **Learning Phase**: Master equipment specialization and environmental challenges

**Phase 2: Consciousness Expansion** 
1. **Transfer Achievement**: Successfully create second probe consciousness
2. **Hybrid Control Activation**: Choose control modes for each probe
3. **Strategic Coordination**: Multi-probe fleet management unlocked

#### Multi-Probe Control Modes

```typescript
enum ProbeControlMode {
  DIRECT = "direct",       // Full player control - 60 FPS updates
  ASSISTED = "assisted",   // AI-assisted with player oversight  
  AUTONOMOUS = "autonomous" // Background operations - infrequent updates
}

class HybridProbeManager {
  activeProbe: Probe;           // Always under direct control
  assistedProbes: Probe[];      // Player sets goals, AI executes efficiently
  autonomousProbes: Probe[];    // Background tasks with simple objectives
  
  // Performance guarantee: Never exceed processing limits
  update(delta: number): void {
    this.activeProbe.update(delta);                    // Full framerate
    this.updateAssistedProbes(delta);                  // Strategic oversight
    this.updateAutonomousProbesOptimized(delta);      // Background processing
  }
}
```

#### Consciousness Transfer Protocol (Performance-Optimized)
**Narrative Experience Preserved**:
```
"Probe Unit 8 construction complete.

```

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Transfer Moment**: Dramatic narrative experience maintained
- **Control Choice**: Player selects engagement level per probe
- **Performance Scaling**: System adapts processing based on control modes
- **Strategic Depth**: Different modes enable different coordination strategies

#### Assisted Mode Capabilities
**Player Sets Strategic Goals**:
- **Resource Targets**: "Mine titanium deposits in sector 7"
- **Equipment Strategy**: "Use mining laser + scanner configuration"  
- **Environmental Constraints**: "Avoid hazardous zones without thermal protection"
- **Coordination Rules**: "Coordinate with other probes to avoid conflicts"

**AI Executes Efficiently**:

- **Predefined Behavior**: Established patterns for routine operations
- **Low-Frequency Updates**: Rotational processing to maintain performance
- **Status Reporting**: Periodic progress updates to player

**Performance Optimization**:
```typescript
class PerformantAutonomousSystem {
  private readonly MAX_BACKGROUND_UPDATES = 1; // Only 1 autonomous probe updated per frame
  
  updateAutonomousProbesOptimized(delta: number): void {
    // Rotate through autonomous probes - spread CPU load across frames
    const probeIndex = Math.floor(Date.now() / 500) % this.autonomousProbes.length;
    if (this.autonomousProbes[probeIndex]) {
      this.autonomousProbes[probeIndex].updateSimplified(delta);
    }
  }
}
```

### Strategic Consciousness Management

#### Control Mode Transitions
**Dynamic Mode Switching**: Players can change probe control modes based on current needs
- **Crisis Response**: Switch autonomous probe to direct control during emergencies
- **Routine Operations**: Delegate direct probe to assisted mode for background tasks
- **Strategic Focus**: Concentrate consciousness on most challenging operations

#### Fleet Coordination Benefits
**Assisted + Autonomous Synergy**:
- **Resource Chain Coordination**: Autonomous miners → Assisted processors → Direct fabrication
- **Environmental Specialization**: Different probes optimized for different hazard zones
- **Efficiency Scaling**: Background operations free player attention for complex decisions

**Performance Guarantee**: System ensures 60 FPS regardless of fleet size through intelligent load distribution
