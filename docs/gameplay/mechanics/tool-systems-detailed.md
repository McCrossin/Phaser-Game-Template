# Tool Systems - Detailed Design Ideas

## Tool Degradation & Progression System Details

### Initial Tool Limitations (Full Specifications)

#### Basic Mining Laser
- **Battery Life**: 2-3 hours of continuous operation
- **Mining Rate**: 1 unit per 5 seconds (slow but functional)
- **Material Limitations**: Can only extract soft ores (iron, silicon, carbon)
- **Durability**: Efficiency decreases as battery depletes
- **Range**: 2-3 grid units maximum effective distance
- **Power Consumption**: High drain during active mining operations

#### Portable Smelter
- **Fuel Requirements**: Needs carbon source for reduction reactions
- **Processing Speed**: 1 ingot per 30 seconds
- **Purity Levels**: Basic refining, 85% purity maximum
- **Temperature Limits**: Cannot process high-melting-point materials
- **Capacity**: Single-item processing queue
- **Energy Source**: Carbon combustion only

#### Manual Assembly Tools
- **Precision Limitations**: Hand-assembly only, no automated production
- **Speed Constraints**: Complex components take 2-3 minutes each
- **Quality Variation**: Manual work introduces error rates
- **Complexity Ceiling**: Cannot manufacture advanced electronics
- **Tool Wear**: Precision decreases over time without maintenance
