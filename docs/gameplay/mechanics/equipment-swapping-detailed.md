# Equipment Swapping Mechanics - Detailed Implementation

## Core System Architecture: Facility-Based Equipment Management

### Strategic Philosophy
Equipment swapping serves as a **strategic planning checkpoint** rather than a reactive adaptation tool. Players must think ahead about mission requirements, creating meaningful decisions about probe specialization and base infrastructure investment.

### Facility-Based Interaction Model

#### Equipment Bay Requirement
**Concept**: Probes must physically return to Equipment Bay facilities to change modules

**Strategic Benefits**:
- **Planning Pressure**: Forces players to consider mission requirements before deployment
- **Facility Value**: Makes Equipment Bays strategically important infrastructure investments
- **Immersive Realism**: Physical equipment changing feels authentic and grounded
- **Specialization Incentive**: Encourages creating dedicated specialist probes rather than constant reconfiguration
- **Base Defense Value**: Equipment Bays become strategic assets worth protecting and expanding

**Implementation Flow**:
1. **Approach Equipment Bay**: Probe moves within interaction range (2-unit radius)
2. **Initiate Interface**: Press 'E' or click Equipment Bay to open swap interface
3. **Equipment Management**: Use 4-slot grid system with dual interaction methods
4. **Instant Configuration**: No time delays or resource costs for equipment changes
5. **Deploy and Execute**: Exit interface and return to field operations with new loadout
