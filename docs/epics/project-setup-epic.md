# Epic: Project Setup and Configuration

## Epic Overview

Establish the foundational development environment, build pipeline, and core technical infrastructure for the New Eden Project. This epic encompasses all initial setup tasks required before game-specific development can begin, ensuring a solid technical foundation that supports the game's performance, maintainability, and scalability requirements.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Initial Project Configuration (SETUP-001)
**As a** developer  
**I want to** set up the base project with Phaser 3, TypeScript, and Vite  
**So that** I have a modern, type-safe development environment with fast build times

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Project builds and runs showing a basic Phaser scene
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode is enabled and enforced
- [ ] Vite provides hot module replacement during development
- [ ] Development tools (ESLint, Prettier) are configured
- [ ] Project structure follows architecture document
- [ ] Performance monitoring is integrated (60 FPS target)

### Story 2: Development Workflow Setup
**As a** developer  
**I want to** establish consistent development workflows and automation  
**So that** code quality is maintained and repetitive tasks are automated

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Git hooks enforce code quality checks before commit
- [ ] Automated testing framework is configured
- [ ] Build scripts for development and production are working
- [ ] Documentation generation is automated
- [ ] Environment configuration is properly managed

### Story 3: CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
**As a** team  
**I want to** have automated build and deployment pipelines  
**So that** we can consistently build, test, and deploy the game

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
- [ ] Build pipeline produces optimized production bundles
- [ ] Deployment to staging environment is automated
- [ ] Build artifacts are properly versioned
- [ ] Performance metrics are tracked in CI

### Story 4: Asset Pipeline Setup
**As a** developer  
**I want to** establish an efficient asset loading and optimization pipeline  
**So that** game assets are properly processed and optimized for web delivery

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Asset optimization tools are integrated into build process
- [ ] Texture atlases are automatically generated
- [ ] Audio files are properly compressed
- [ ] Asset preloading strategy is implemented
- [ ] Asset versioning for cache busting is configured

### Story 5: Performance Monitoring Infrastructure
**As a** developer  
**I want to** have performance monitoring and profiling tools integrated  
**So that** I can ensure the game maintains 60 FPS across different scenarios

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] FPS monitoring is integrated into development builds
- [ ] Memory usage tracking is implemented
- [ ] Performance profiling tools are configured
- [ ] Performance regression detection is automated
- [ ] Performance dashboards are available

## Technical Requirements

### Development Environment
- Node.js 22 LTS (v22.17.1+) for package management
- TypeScript 5.8+ with strict mode configuration (5.9 beta available)
- Phaser 3.85+ as the game engine (latest stable)
- Vite 7.0+ as the build tool for fast development

### Code Quality Tools
- ESLint with TypeScript plugin for linting
- Prettier for consistent code formatting
- Husky for Git hooks automation
- Vitest or similar for unit testing

### Build and Deployment
- Optimized production builds with code splitting
- Source map generation for debugging
- Environment-specific configurations
- Automated deployment scripts

### Performance Standards
- Initial load time under 3 seconds
- 60 FPS target on mid-range hardware
- Memory usage baseline under 50MB
- Bundle size optimization (initial load <2MB)

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- **Phaser 3**: Core game engine
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and better developer experience
- **Vite**: Modern build tool with HMR support
- **Testing Framework**: For automated testing

### Internal Dependencies
- **Game Architecture Document**: Defines project structure and standards
- **Game Design Document**: Provides performance and platform requirements
- **CLAUDE.md**: AI development context and guidelines

## Estimated Effort

### Story Estimates
1. Initial Project Configuration: **3 points** (1-2 days)
2. Development Workflow Setup: **5 points** (2-3 days)
3. CI/CD Pipeline Configuration: **8 points** (3-4 days)
4. Asset Pipeline Setup: **5 points** (2-3 days)
5. Performance Monitoring Infrastructure: **5 points** (2-3 days)

### Total Epic Estimate
**26 story points** (approximately 2-3 weeks)

### Priority and Phasing
This is a **Phase 1** epic that must be completed before any game-specific development begins. All stories in this epic are considered high priority, with Initial Project Configuration (SETUP-001) being the first story that must be completed.

### Risk Factors
- **Technical Debt**: Rushing setup may lead to issues later
- **Tool Compatibility**: Ensuring all tools work well together
- **Performance Baseline**: Setting realistic initial performance targets
- **Team Onboarding**: Ensuring all developers can work efficiently in the environment

### Success Metrics
- All developers can clone and run the project in <5 minutes
- Build times remain under 3 seconds for development builds
- No more than 1 build failure per week due to environment issues
- 100% of commits pass automated quality checks
- Performance targets are met in empty scene baseline
