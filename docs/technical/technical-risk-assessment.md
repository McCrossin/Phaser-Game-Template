## Critical Technical Risks (High Impact)

### 1. Performance Degradation with Fleet Scaling

**Risk Level**: HIGH (High Probability × High Impact)  
**Description**: Game performance drops below 60 FPS when managing multiple probes with complex equipment and large solar arrays.

#### Technical Details
- **Bottleneck Sources**: 
  - Energy calculations for 10+ probes every 100ms
  - Rendering solar panel arrays (100+ panels potential)
  - Equipment state management across multiple probes
  - World state updates for large explored areas

- **Performance Budget Breakdown**:
  ```javascript
  Target: 16.67ms per frame (60 FPS)
  Energy System: 2ms max
  Rendering: 8ms max
  Game Logic: 4ms max
  UI Updates: 2ms max
  Buffer: 0.67ms
  ```

#### Risk Indicators
- [ ] **Early Warning**: Frame drops to 55 FPS with 3 probes
- [ ] **Critical Threshold**: Frame drops to 45 FPS with 5 probes  
- [ ] **Failure Point**: Unplayable performance (<30 FPS) with target fleet sizes

#### Mitigation Strategies

**Primary Prevention**:
- Object pooling for all probe instances and equipment
- Optimized energy update frequency (reduce to 200ms intervals if needed)
- Level-of-detail rendering for distant solar panels
- Spatial partitioning for world updates (only update visible areas)

**Contingency Planning**:
- Fleet size limits (max 5 probes for MVP)
- Performance scaling options (reduce visual effects, lower update frequencies)
- Emergency performance mode (disable non-essential systems)

**Implementation Code Example**:
```javascript
class PerformanceManager {
    constructor() {
        this.frameTimeHistory = [];
        this.performanceMode = 'optimal';
    }
    
    updatePerformanceMode() {
        const avgFrameTime = this.getAverageFrameTime();
        
        if (avgFrameTime > 20) { // Below 50 FPS
            this.enableReducedPerformanceMode();
        } else if (avgFrameTime > 18) { // Below 55 FPS
            this.enableOptimizedMode();
        }
    }
    
    enableReducedPerformanceMode() {
        // Reduce energy update frequency to 500ms
        // Disable particle effects
        // Reduce solar panel detail
        this.performanceMode = 'reduced';
    }
}
```

#### Testing & Validation
- **Stress Testing**: 10 probes + 200 solar panels + complex world
- **Hardware Testing**: Low-end devices (4GB RAM, integrated graphics)
- **Automated Performance Tests**: Continuous integration with performance benchmarks

### 2. Save/Load System Corruption & Data Loss

**Risk Level**: HIGH (Medium Probability × High Impact)  
**Description**: Complex game state serialization leads to save corruption, data loss, or failed save/load operations.

#### Technical Details
- **Complexity Sources**:
  - Multi-probe fleet state with complex equipment configurations
  - Large procedural world state (resources, environmental changes)
  - Circuit technology progression and automation systems
  - Equipment instances with individual wear/upgrade states

- **Data Volume Estimates**:
  ```
  Single Probe State: ~2KB
  Equipment Configurations: ~1KB per probe
  World State (1000x1000): ~5-10MB
  Resource Distribution: ~2-5MB
  Progress/Achievements: ~1KB
  Total Estimated: 10-20MB per save
  ```

#### Risk Indicators
- [ ] **Early Warning**: Save times >3 seconds on target hardware
- [ ] **Critical Threshold**: Save corruption rate >0.1% in testing
- [ ] **Failure Point**: Unable to restore saves or data loss incidents

#### Mitigation Strategies

**Primary Prevention**:
- Incremental save system (only save changed data)
- Multi-layered validation (checksums, data type verification, range checking)
- Automatic backup system (keep 3 most recent saves)
- Compression with LZ-String to reduce data size

**Data Integrity Framework**:
```javascript
class SaveDataValidator {
    validateSaveData(saveData) {
        const validationRules = {
            probes: this.validateProbeArray,
            world: this.validateWorldState,
            equipment: this.validateEquipmentData,
            energy: this.validateEnergyState
        };
        
        for (const [key, validator] of Object.entries(validationRules)) {
            if (!validator(saveData[key])) {
                throw new SaveValidationError(`Invalid ${key} data`);
            }
        }
        
        return this.generateChecksum(saveData);
    }
    
    validateProbeArray(probes) {
        return Array.isArray(probes) && 
               probes.length <= this.MAX_PROBES &&
               probes.every(probe => this.validateSingleProbe(probe));
    }
}
```

**Contingency Planning**:
- Emergency save recovery system
- Partial save restoration (recover what's possible)
- Debug save inspector for development team
- User-accessible save export/import

#### Testing & Validation
- **Automated Save Testing**: 10,000 save/load cycles in CI
- **Corruption Simulation**: Intentional data corruption testing
- **Edge Case Testing**: Maximum complexity saves, minimal saves, interrupted saves

### 3. Energy System Balance Breaking Game Flow

**Risk Level**: HIGH (Medium Probability × High Impact)  
**Description**: Energy constraints either too punishing (halting progression) or too lenient (removing strategic depth).

#### Technical Details
- **Balance Dependencies**:

  - Equipment power consumption scaling (10W-4500W range)
  - Solar panel efficiency (25% alien planet scaling)
  - Battery capacity progression (10-40 kWh)

- **Critical Balance Points**:
  ```
  Tutorial Completion: 6 kWh budget in 15 minutes
  Circuit Manufacturing: 30 kWh requirement
  Probe Replication: 600 kWh infrastructure
  Multi-Probe Operations: 2000W+ solar requirement
  ```

#### Risk Indicators
- [ ] **Early Warning**: Tutorial completion rate <80% due to energy constraints

- [ ] **Failure Point**: Players unable to progress or energy becomes irrelevant

#### Mitigation Strategies

**Primary Prevention**:
- Extensive balance testing with player feedback integration
- Configurable difficulty levels (energy consumption multipliers)
- Real-time balance monitoring and adjustment capability
- Progressive difficulty scaling based on player performance

**Dynamic Balance System**:
```javascript
class AdaptiveBalanceManager {
    constructor() {
        this.playerPerformanceData = {};
        this.balanceMultipliers = {
            energyConsumption: 1.0,
            solarGeneration: 1.0,
            manufacturingTime: 1.0
        };
    }
    
    adjustBalanceBasedOnPerformance(playerId, milestone, completionTime) {
        const expectedTime = this.getMilestoneTarget(milestone);
        const performanceRatio = completionTime / expectedTime;
        
        if (performanceRatio > 1.5) { // Taking 50% longer than expected
            this.suggestEasierBalance();
        } else if (performanceRatio < 0.7) { // Completing 30% faster
            this.suggestHarderBalance();
        }
    }
}
```

**Contingency Planning**:
- Emergency balance patches (server-configurable values)
- Alternative progression paths (skip problematic phases)
- Player assistance systems (hint system, auto-optimization)

#### Testing & Validation
- **Player Testing**: 20+ players through full progression
- **A/B Testing**: Multiple balance configurations
