# New Eden Project Business Strategy

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive market research of automation-strategy games, **Premium Early Access** is the recommended monetization strategy for New Eden Project. This approach aligns with successful precedents like Satisfactory ($100M+ in Early Access) and Deep Rock Galactic ($150M+ lifetime revenue).

## Monetization Strategy Decision

**SELECTED APPROACH**: Premium Early Access Model

**Key Decision Factors**:
- **Genre Precedent**: Automation-strategy games consistently succeed with premium models
- **Audience Analysis**: PC strategy players (ages 25-40) prefer complete experiences over F2P
- **Revenue Timeline**: Early Access provides cash flow during development while building community
- **Market Research**: F2P models have failed consistently in automation-strategy genre

## Early Access Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Early Access Launch (Month 6-8 of Development)**
- **Price Point**: $19.99 USD (25% below planned full release price)
- **Target Revenue**: $1M-$2M from 50,000-100,000 copies
- **Content Scope**: 
  - Complete tutorial system (45-60 minutes as designed)
  - First replication cycle with 2-3 planet types
  - Equipment system fully functional (all 4 slots)
  - Circuit technology through Tier 4 (mid-game automation)
  - 15-20 hours of core content

**Quality Requirements for Early Access Launch**:
- Tutorial must be polished and complete
- Core automation loop must be stable and engaging
- Save/load system must be reliable
- Performance target: 60 FPS on target hardware
- Equipment swapping must feel intuitive

### **Phase 2: Early Access Development (6-month update cycles)**
- **Pricing**: Maintain $19.99 throughout Early Access period
- **Update Schedule**: Major content updates every 6 months
- **Target Additional Revenue**: $2M-$4M from continued sales

**Planned Updates**:
1. **Update 1**: New planet types + environmental challenges
2. **Update 2**: Advanced circuit tiers (5-7) + manufacturing chains  
3. **Update 3**: Interplanetary systems + fleet management

### **Phase 3: 1.0 Launch (18-24 months post-Early Access)**
- **Price Point**: $24.99 USD (target market sweet spot)
- **Content**: Complete feature set as per GDD
- **Marketing**: Full launch campaign leveraging Early Access success
- **Target Revenue**: $5M-$12.5M from 200,000-500,000 additional copies

## Revenue Projections

**Total 3-Year Revenue Projection**:
- **Conservative**: $8M
- **Moderate**: $15M  
- **Success**: $25M+ (Satisfactory-level success)

**Revenue Breakdown by Phase**:
- Early Access Launch: $1M-$2M
- Early Access Updates: $2M-$4M
- 1.0 Launch: $5M-$12.5M
- Post-Launch DLC Potential: $2M-$5M

## Market Analysis Summary

### **Target Audience Profile**
- **Demographics**: Ages 25-40, higher disposable income, PC-focused
- **Platform Preference**: 95%+ PC, minimal mobile crossover
- **Spending Behavior**: Prefer premium purchases over microtransactions
- **Session Length**: 2-8 hour uninterrupted sessions
- **Community Values**: Hostile to pay-to-win, value fairness

### **Competitive Landscape Success Factors**
- **Factorio**: $105M+ revenue with $30 premium pricing, never discounted
- **Satisfactory**: $100M+ in Early Access alone, $29.99 pricing
- **Deep Rock Galactic**: $150M+ lifetime, successful Early Access model
- **Key Pattern**: All successful automation-strategy games use premium pricing

### **F2P Model Rejection Rationale**
Based on extensive market research, F2P models are **unsuitable** for New Eden Project:

1. **Genre Mismatch**: PC automation-strategy audiences overwhelmingly reject F2P
2. **Session Length Incompatibility**: 2-8 hour sessions conflict with F2P engagement mechanics
3. **Complexity Barriers**: Equipment and circuit systems too complex for F2P gating
4. **Community Hostility**: Strategy players actively reject pay-to-win mechanics
5. **Development Resource Conflict**: F2P requires ongoing cosmetic content vs. system depth

## Marketing Strategy Integration

### **Early Access Marketing Approach**
- **Target Channels**: Steam wishlists, automation-strategy community forums, YouTube/Twitch content creators
- **Messaging**: "Deep automation systems," "Complete experience without microtransactions"
- **Community Building**: Developer blogs, progress updates, feedback integration showcase

### **1.0 Launch Marketing**
- **Leverage Early Access Success**: Community testimonials, content creator partnerships
- **Media Outreach**: Gaming press focused on indie and strategy game coverage
- **Platform Strategy**: Steam primary, potential Epic Games Store launch consideration

## Business Risk Mitigation

### **Early Access Risks and Mitigation**
1. **Quality Expectations**: Launch only when tutorial and core loop are genuinely fun
2. **Development Pressure**: Maintain 6-month update schedule, communicate delays transparently
3. **Community Management**: Active engagement with feedback, clear roadmap communication
4. **Competition Response**: Focus on unique probe consciousness and circuit progression differentiators

### **Revenue Diversification Opportunities**
- **Expansion DLC**: New planet types, advanced manufacturing chains ($14.99)
- **Soundtrack Release**: Separate purchase for music enthusiasts ($9.99)
- **Merchandise**: Community-driven items for dedicated fanbase
- **Platform Expansion**: Console versions post-PC success
