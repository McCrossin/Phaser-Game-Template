# Story: Template Quality Assurance - Comprehensive Testing Suite

**ID**: TEMP-018  
**Epic**: TEMPLATE-VALIDATION  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Points**: 8  
**Dependencies**: TEMP-001 through TEMP-017

## Description

Implement a comprehensive testing suite to validate the Phaser 2D Game Template is completely clean, error-free, and warning-free after the template conversion process. This story focuses on ensuring the template meets the highest quality standards with zero tolerance for warnings or errors that would normally be acceptable in active game development.

### Player Experience Goal

Template users will receive a pristine, professional-grade starting point that builds and runs flawlessly without any console warnings, errors, or failed tests, providing confidence in the template's quality and reliability.
