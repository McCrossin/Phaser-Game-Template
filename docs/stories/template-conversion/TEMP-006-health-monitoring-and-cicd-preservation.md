# Story: Preserve and Document Health Monitoring & CI/CD Systems
**ID**: TEMP-006  
**Epic**: Template Conversion  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Points**: 2  
**Dependencies**: TEMP-001, TEMP-002, TEMP-004

## Description

Ensure all health monitoring, performance benchmarking, and CI/CD pipeline systems are preserved and properly documented for template users. These are key differentiating features of this template that should be maintained and easily configurable.

### Player Experience Goal
Template users will have access to professional-grade monitoring, health checks, and automated testing pipelines that are typically only found in enterprise projects, giving their indie games production-quality infrastructure.

### Technical Overview
Audit, test, and document all existing monitoring and automation systems. Ensure they work generically for any project while maintaining their sophisticated functionality. Create configuration guides for customizing these systems.

## Technical Specifications

### Health Monitoring Systems to Preserve

1. **Health Check System** (`tools/monitoring/health-check.ts`)
   - Project health assessment
   - Code quality metrics
   - Dependency analysis
   - Performance indicators

2. **Technical Debt Tracker** (`tools/monitoring/technical-debt-tracker.ts`)
   - Code complexity analysis
   - Technical debt reporting
   - Maintenance recommendations
   - Quality trend tracking

3. **Performance Testing** (`scripts/test-performance.sh`)
   - Build performance benchmarks
   - Runtime performance testing
   - Memory usage analysis
   - Frame rate monitoring

4. **GitHub Actions Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/`)
   - Automated testing
   - Build verification
   - Quality checks
   - Deployment automation

### Configuration Updates Required

#### Health Check Configuration
```typescript
// tools/monitoring/health-check.ts - Generic project checks
interface HealthCheckConfig {
  projectName: string;          // Configurable project name
  performanceTargets: {
    buildTime: number;          // Max build time (seconds)
    bundleSize: number;         // Max bundle size (MB)
    frameRate: number;          // Target FPS
  };
  qualityThresholds: {
    testCoverage: number;       // Minimum test coverage %
    codeComplexity: number;     // Max cyclomatic complexity
    techDebtScore: number;      // Max technical debt score
  };
}
```

#### CI/CD Pipeline Updates
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml - Template-ready pipeline
name: Template CI/CD
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      # ... rest of pipeline
```

### Documentation Requirements

1. **Monitoring Systems Overview** (`docs/features/health-monitoring.md`)
   - What monitoring systems are included
   - How they benefit game development
   - Configuration options
   - Usage examples

2. **CI/CD Setup Guide** (`docs/features/ci-cd-pipeline.md`)
   - GitHub Actions configuration
   - Automated testing setup
   - Deployment configuration
   - Customization options

3. **Performance Tools Guide** (`docs/features/performance-tools.md`)
   - Performance benchmarking tools
   - Optimization recommendations
   - Monitoring setup
   - Target configuration
