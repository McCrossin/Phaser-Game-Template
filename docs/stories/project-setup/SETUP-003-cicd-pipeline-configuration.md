# Story: CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
**ID**: SETUP-003  
**Epic**: Project Setup and Configuration  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Points**: 3 (MVP) / 8 (Full Implementation)  
**Dependencies**: SETUP-001 (Initial Project Configuration), SETUP-002 (Development Workflow Setup)

## Description

Establish automated continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions to ensure consistent builds, automated testing, and reliable deployments. This story implements workflows for pull request validation, main branch protection, automated versioning, and deployment to staging/production environments, creating a robust delivery pipeline that maintains code quality at scale. Following 2025 best practices, the pipeline achieves up to 80% efficiency boost with advanced performance monitoring, security scanning, and cost optimization through dynamic scaling.

### Player Experience Goal
Players benefit from more frequent, stable releases with fewer bugs. The automated pipeline catches issues before they reach production, ensures consistent performance across deployments, and enables rapid hotfix delivery when needed. This results in a more polished, reliable gaming experience with minimal downtime.

### Technical Overview
Configure GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing, building, and deployment. Implement branch protection rules, automated version tagging, performance benchmarking, and multi-environment deployments. Integrate with the testing framework from SETUP-002 and build configuration from SETUP-001.

**MVP Approach**: Start with essential CI/CD features (test, build, basic deploy) and progressively enhance with advanced monitoring and optimization features as the game matures. Focus on rapid iteration for core gameplay loop refinement.

            branch: 'tags',
            requiresApproval: true
        }
    },
    rollback: {
        maxVersionsKept: 5,
        rollbackWindow: '24h'
    },
    monitoring: {
        errorThreshold: 0.1, // 0.1% error rate
        performanceThreshold: 55 // min FPS
    }
};
```
