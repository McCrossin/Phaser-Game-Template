# Documentation Overview

This documentation structure provides templates and guidelines for creating comprehensive game development documentation. The templates are designed to support any 2D game project built with modern web technologies.

## üéØ Template Usage

### For New Game Projects

1. **Start with Game Design Document**
   - Copy `templates/game-design-document-template.md`
   - Replace all `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` text with your game details
   - Use this as your primary design reference

2. **Define Technical Architecture**
   - Copy `templates/technical-architecture-template.md`
   - Specify your technology stack and system design
   - Document performance requirements and constraints

3. **Create Implementation Plan**
   - Copy `templates/implementation-prd-template.md`
   - Break down development into epics and stories
   - Define success metrics and validation criteria

4. **Document Individual Features**
   - Use `templates/story-template.md` for each development story
   - Ensure each story has clear acceptance criteria
   - Link stories to your overall implementation plan

### Template Customization Guidelines

#### Placeholder Replacement
- `{{GAME_NAME}}`: Your game's title
- `{{GENRE}}`: Game genre (e.g., platformer, puzzle, strategy)
- `{{TECH_STACK}}`: Technology choices (e.g., Phaser 3 + TypeScript)
- `{{CORE_MECHANIC}}`: Primary gameplay mechanic
- `{{PERFORMANCE_TARGET}}`: Performance goals (e.g., 60 FPS on mid-range hardware)

#### Section Expansion
- Add sections specific to your game's unique features
- Remove sections that don't apply to your project
- Expand technical sections based on complexity needs

#### Cross-References
- Link related documents using relative paths
- Maintain consistency in naming conventions
- Update all references when reorganizing structure

## üìã Documentation Best Practices

### Content Guidelines

#### Writing Style
- Use clear, concise language
- Write for your target audience (developers, designers, stakeholders)
- Include examples and code snippets where helpful
- Maintain consistent terminology throughout

#### Structure Principles
- Start with overview, then dive into details
- Use hierarchical organization (h1 > h2 > h3)
- Include table of contents for long documents
- End with quick reference sections

#### Technical Documentation
- Include code examples in proper syntax highlighting
- Document all public APIs and interfaces
- Specify version requirements for dependencies
- Include performance benchmarks and targets

### Maintenance

#### Version Control
- Track significant changes in changelog sections
- Use semantic versioning for major documentation updates
- Tag releases that correspond to implementation milestones

#### Review Process
- Regular documentation reviews during development
- Update documentation alongside code changes
- Validate examples and code snippets remain accurate

#### Quality Assurance
- Check all internal links work correctly
- Verify placeholder text has been replaced
- Ensure consistency in formatting and style
- Test documented procedures and examples

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow Integration

### Story-Driven Development
1. Create story from template for each feature
2. Define acceptance criteria before implementation
3. Update story status during development
4. Mark complete when all criteria met

### Architecture Documentation
1. Document decisions before implementation
2. Update architecture docs when making changes
3. Include rationale for significant decisions
4. Maintain system integration diagrams

### Quality Gates
- [ ] All placeholder text replaced with project-specific content
- [ ] Technical specifications align with implementation
- [ ] Cross-references and links are functional
- [ ] Documentation builds without errors
- [ ] Style and formatting guidelines followed

## üìö Additional Resources

### Documentation Tools
- **Markdown**: Primary format for all documentation
- **Mermaid**: Diagrams and flowcharts in markdown
- **PlantUML**: Complex system diagrams (optional)
- **JSDoc**: Code documentation generation

### Example Projects
Look at the existing project structure for examples of:
- File organization patterns
- Documentation depth and detail
- Cross-referencing between documents
- Integration with development tools

## üéÆ Game-Specific Considerations

### 2D Game Documentation
- Include sprite and animation specifications
- Document scene transitions and state management
- Specify input controls and user interactions
- Define asset pipeline and optimization requirements

### Performance Documentation
- Frame rate targets for different hardware tiers
- Memory usage constraints and optimization strategies
- Loading time requirements and asset streaming
- Platform-specific performance considerations

### Content Pipeline
- Asset creation and processing workflows
- Content iteration and approval processes
- Localization and accessibility requirements
- Version control for art and audio assets

**Getting Started**: Begin with the Game Design Document template to establish your project vision, then use the other templates to build out your complete documentation suite. Remember to customize each template for your specific project needs and maintain documentation throughout development.
