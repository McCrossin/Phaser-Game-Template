# World Generation - Detailed Design Ideas

## Planet Personality Implementation Details

### Aggressive Storms
- Frequent dust storms reduce solar panel efficiency by 30-60%
- High winds enable wind power generation (unavailable on calm worlds)
- Equipment durability reduced, requiring more maintenance automation
- Storm shelters and underground construction become strategic advantages

### Predictable Resources
- Surface deposits clearly visible and well-mapped from orbit
- Consistent extraction rates and known depletion timelines
- Ideal for players preferring planned, methodical automation expansion
- Lower discovery rewards but higher planning reliability

### Mysterious Deposits
- Hidden underground resources revealed through exploration gameplay
- Seismic surveys, core sampling, and spectrographic analysis mechanics
- Rare material caches reward thorough planetary exploration
- Discovery events provide significant resource bonuses

## Geological Storytelling System
- **Impact Craters** - Asteroid strikes create rare metal concentrations (platinum, iridium)
- **Volcanic Zones** - Geothermal energy sources with sulfur and rare earth deposits
- **Ancient Riverbeds** - Sedimentary deposits with concentrated minerals and water access
- **Tectonic Activity** - Fault lines expose deep materials but create unstable terrain

## Energy Generation Environmental Factors

### Solar Efficiency Variations
- **Close to Star** (0.8-1.2 AU) - 120-150% solar efficiency, higher cooling requirements
- **Optimal Distance** (1.0 AU) - 100% baseline solar efficiency
- **Far from Star** (1.5-2.0 AU) - 60-80% solar efficiency, benefits: geothermal bonus, lower cooling needs

### Alternative Energy Sources
- **Distant Worlds** - Enhanced geothermal activity, fusion material deposits
- **High Atmosphere Density** - Wind power becomes viable energy source
- **Volcanic Activity** - Geothermal plants provide consistent baseline power
- **Oil/Hydrocarbon Deposits** - Chemical energy for transitional power systems

## Resource Scarcity Design Details

### Starter Planet Guarantees
- **Core Materials** - Iron, Silicon, Carbon, Aluminum (sufficient for 3D printer and first probe)
- **Basic Energy** - At least one viable power generation method
- **Water/Hydrogen** - Essential for chemical processes and life support
- **Missing Advanced Materials** - Rare earths, noble gases, isotopes require exploration

### Finite vs. Renewable Balance
- **Renewable Sources** - Solar, wind, geothermal, atmospheric gases
- **Finite Deposits** - Metal ores, oil, rare material veins
- **Recycling Systems** - Advanced automation can reclaim materials from waste
- **Exploration Rewards** - Asteroid mining provides virtually unlimited resources
