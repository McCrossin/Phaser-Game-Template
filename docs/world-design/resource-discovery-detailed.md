### Equipment Degradation in Extreme Environments
- **Corrosive Atmospheres**: Standard equipment suffers accelerated wear in sulfur-rich environments
- **Pressure Stress**: Deep ocean operations gradually damage non-reinforced components
- **Thermal Shock**: Rapid temperature changes reduce tool effectiveness and lifespan
- **Radiation Exposure**: Electronics degrade over time in high-radiation environments

### Strategic Environmental Engineering
- **Pre-Deployment Planning**: Analyze environmental conditions before committing specialized probes
- **Emergency Protocols**: Evacuation procedures when environmental conditions exceed safety limits
- **Equipment Redundancy**: Backup systems critical for extreme environment operations
- **Resource ROI Analysis**: Calculate extraction value vs. equipment investment and risk factors
