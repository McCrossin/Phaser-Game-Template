      gameObject.x = dragX;
      gameObject.y = dragY;
    });
    
    scene.input.on('drop', (pointer, gameObject, dropZone) => {
      this.handleEquipmentDrop(gameObject, dropZone);
    });
  }
}
```

### 2. Probe Consciousness & Direct Control

- 60 FPS movement easily achievable with proper delta time handling

### 3. Circuit Technology Progression System
**Status**: **EXCELLENTLY DESIGNED** - Major improvement from previous designs

**Outstanding Design Evolution**:
The 7-tier circuit system (28nm → 14nm → 7nm → 5nm → 3nm → 1nm → Sub-nm) represents a significant improvement over previous consultant feedback. This system elegantly balances:

- **Engineering Authenticity**: Real semiconductor progression that engineers will appreciate
- **Player Progression**: Clear technological advancement with meaningful automation unlocks
- **Performance Optimization**: Discrete lookup tables avoid any complex calculations
- **Long-term Motivation**: Provides compelling progression path beyond initial replication

**Implementation Approach**:
```typescript
enum CircuitTier {
  FOUNDATION = "28nm",    // Tutorial phase - basic automation
  IMPROVED = "14nm",      // Early game - multi-probe coordination  
  PRECISION = "7nm",      // Mid game - smart resource management
  ADVANCED = "5nm",       // Late game - advanced automation
  EXPERIMENTAL = "3nm",   // Expert play - laboratory-grade tech
  QUANTUM = "1nm",        // Mastery - quantum-precision manufacturing
  TRANSCENDENT = "sub-nm" // Theoretical - consciousness enhancement
}
```

### 4. Resource Discovery & Periodic Table Integration
**Status**: **EXCELLENT PHASER 3 FIT** - Implement as specified

**Design Strengths**:
- 118-element discovery system works perfectly with sprite-based visualization
- Progressive revelation system (Basic → Detailed → Geological → Predictive) ideal for UI evolution
- Discovery-based chemistry with discrete processing balances engagement with performance
- Color-coded element categories provide clear visual organization

### 5. Solar Energy & Power Management
**Status**: **STRATEGICALLY OPTIMIZED** - Outstanding performance design

**Exceptional Implementation Strategy**:
The discrete energy system with 100ms update intervals represents excellent engineering:

```typescript
class PerformantEnergySystem {
  private readonly EFFICIENCY_LOOKUP = {
    dawn: { north: 20, east: 80, south: 40, west: 20 },
    midday: { north: 40, east: 60, south: 100, west: 60 },
    dusk: { north: 20, east: 20, south: 40, west: 80 },
    night: { north: 0, east: 0, south: 0, west: 0 }
  };
  
  private readonly UPDATE_INTERVAL = 100; // ms
  
  // Reduces calculations from 60/second to 10/second per probe
  update(delta: number): void {
    this.updateTimer += delta;
    if (this.updateTimer >= this.UPDATE_INTERVAL) {
      this.calculatePowerGeneration();
      this.updateTimer = 0;
    }
  }
}
```

**Strategic Depth Preserved**: Panel placement and directional efficiency create meaningful decisions while maintaining 60 FPS performance.

- **Direct Mode**: 1 probe maximum with full 60 FPS updates
- **Assisted Mode**: 2-3 probes with AI execution and player oversight  
- **Autonomous Mode**: Unlimited probes with background rotational updates

**Performance Implementation**:
```typescript
class HybridProbeManager {
  private readonly MAX_DIRECT_PROBES = 1;
  private readonly MAX_ASSISTED_PROBES = 3;
  
  update(delta: number): void {
    // Always update active probe at full framerate
    this.activeProbe.update(delta);
    
    // Update assisted probes with simplified logic  
    this.assistedProbes.forEach(probe => probe.updateAssisted(delta));
    
    // Rotate autonomous probe updates across frames
    this.updateAutonomousRotation(delta);
  }
}
```

**Implementation Confidence**: 85% with proper load distribution testing

### 7. World Generation & Procedural Systems
**Status**: **PERFORMANCE-OPTIMIZED DESIGN** - Tilemap-based approach

**Technical Implementation Strategy**:
- Phaser tilemap system for efficient rendering (64x64 tile chunks)
- Pre-generated resource placement during loading screens (not runtime)
- Geological storytelling through placement algorithms, not real-time simulation
- Discrete environmental zones for hazard/protection mechanics

**Performance Confidence**: 90% - well within Phaser 3's proven capabilities

## ✅ SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED SYSTEMS

### 8. Chemical Processing & Materials System
**Previous Assessment**: Performance concerns with real-time simulation
**Current Status**: **EXCELLENTLY RESOLVED** 

The evolution to a discovery/discrete hybrid approach represents outstanding design iteration:

**Discovery Phase** (Engaging):
- Players experiment with realistic element combinations
- Chemical logic produces intuitive results
- Engineering insights maintain educational authenticity

**Processing Phase** (Performant):
- Discrete recipes with instant completion
- Fixed energy costs and processing times
- Zero impact from real-time chemical simulation

```typescript
interface ChemicalDiscovery {
  inputs: ResourceType[];
  outputs: ResourceType[];
  engineeringInsight: string;
  processingData: DiscreteRecipe;
}

class UnifiedChemicalSystem {
  // Discovery maintains engagement
  experimentWithCombination(materials: ResourceType[]): ChemicalDiscovery | null {
    if (this.isValidChemistry(materials)) {
      return this.createDiscovery(materials);
    }
    return null; // Failed experiments teach through failure
  }
  
  // Processing optimized for performance
  processRecipe(recipe: ChemicalDiscovery): ProcessingResult {
    return {
      energyConsumed: recipe.processingData.energyRequirement,
      timeRequired: recipe.processingData.processingTime,
      outputs: recipe.outputs
    };
  }
}
```

This represents a major improvement and demonstrates excellent design evolution.

## 🔧 CRITICAL TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### 1. TypeScript Implementation (Essential)
**Justification**: Complex state management, equipment system type safety, AI-assisted development

**Required Implementation**:
```typescript
interface Equipment {
  readonly type: EquipmentType;
  readonly powerConsumption: number;
  readonly slotRequirement: 1 | 2; // Multi-slot equipment like Pressure Hull
  readonly environmentalTolerance: EnvironmentalConditions;
  readonly compatibilityChecks: CompatibilityFunction[];
}

interface Probe {
  readonly id: string;
  readonly controlMode: ProbeControlMode;
  readonly equipment: Equipment[];
  readonly energySystem: EnergyManagement;
  readonly position: Phaser.Math.Vector2;
}
```

### 2. Performance Monitoring System (Critical)
**Requirement**: Built-in FPS monitoring with automatic performance scaling

```typescript
class PerformanceManager {
  private frameTimeHistory: number[] = [];
  private performanceMode: 'optimal' | 'reduced' | 'emergency' = 'optimal';
  
  updatePerformanceMode(): void {
    const avgFrameTime = this.getAverageFrameTime();
    
    if (avgFrameTime > 20) { // Below 50 FPS
      this.enableEmergencyMode();
    } else if (avgFrameTime > 18) { // Below 55 FPS
      this.enableReducedMode();
    }
  }
  
  enableReducedMode(): void {
    // Reduce energy update frequency to 200ms
    // Disable non-essential particle effects
    // Reduce solar panel rendering detail
  }
}
```

### 3. Component-Based Architecture (Essential)
**Critical For**: Equipment modularity, probe fleet management, automation scaling

```typescript
interface PerformantGameComponent {
  readonly updateFrequency: 'frame' | 'frequent' | 'infrequent';
  readonly priority: 'critical' | 'normal' | 'background';
  
  update(delta: number): void;          // Full processing
  updateSimplified(delta: number): void; // Background processing
}
```
